# Installation

Go to your setup page and click on the **Add-on Modules** Tab.

Hit the button **Install Module** at the bottom.

Insert the module URL https://github.com/BernhardPosselt/foundryvtt-special-dice-roller/raw/master/module.json and click **Install**.

After you've launched your game, go to the Game Settings page and click on **Manage Modules**. Enable the Special Dice Roller app and hit **Save Module Settings**.


# Usage

You can roll a system by starting your message with the following string:

* Legend of the 5 Rings: /l5r
* FFG Star Wars: /sw
* FFG Genesys: /gen
* Vampire the Masquerade: /v5
* HeroQuest: /hq
* HeXXen 1733: /hex
* Warhammer 3rd: /wfrp3
* The One Ring: /tor
* Descent: /desc2

Then supply a dice formula separated with a space. The formula consists of dice letters that are optionally prefixed with a number.

The roll can also contain an optional flavour text by adding a #. Everything behind the first # will be treated as flavour text.

A full roll example would be **/l5r rrs** or **/l5r 2rs**.

An example with flavour text would be **/l5r rss # comment**.

## Usage L5R

Roll Legend of the 5 Rings 5th edition dice in the chat window. Auto rolls exploding successes and let's you keep/re-roll selected dice.

Use the **/l5r** command using the following dice letters:

* r, b: ring
* s, w: skill

You can choose to either keep or re-roll certain dice. To do that, click on the dice to select them and hit either button. Re-rolled dice are removed from the roll and new rolls are attached at the end.

# Building the Project

Install **yarn** and run:

    yarn install
    yarn build

Tests use Jest and are run via:

    yarn test
    
TSLint is used to lint files on build. You can run it separately via

    yarn run lint

and fix simple errors automatically via:

    yarn run fix

The relevant files and folders that need to be included in your (local) FoundryVTT module folder are:

* module.json
* dist/
* public/

Further development documentation is included in the docs/ folder.

# Rolling Dice Programmatically

You can access the dice roller API via the game object:

```js
game.specialDiceRoller.l5r
game.specialDiceRoller.v5
game.specialDiceRoller.genesys
game.specialDiceRoller.starWars
game.specialDiceRoller.heroQuest
game.specialDiceRoller.heXXen
game.specialDiceRoller.warhammer3
game.specialDiceRoller.tor
game.specialDiceRoller.desc2
```

Each roller object has a rollFormula method:

```ts
class Roller {
    /**
     * @param fomula essentially the command without the roller prefix (e.g. wwbb instead of /l5r wwbb)
     * @param flavorText? flavor text to display above the roll
     * @return the HTML for the chat window
     */
    rollFormula(formula: string, flavorText?: string): string {
        // etc
    }
}
```

This method returns the formatted HTML for a roll. You can insert that into the chat log content.
